<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How will Transition work this year?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Miss Milward&nbsp;is the key member of the Senior Leadership Team who will be overseeing and organising the transition work for this year.&nbsp; We will be working alongside the Head of Year 7, Miss Miller,&nbsp; to support all of our students to make the transition to secondary school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are welcome to get in touch if you have individual concerns or questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>During the transition process we will:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Speak to your primary schools to find out all about you. This will help us to place you in a form group.</span></li>

<h4>Chromebooks for Learning</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 2020, we moved to all pupils using a device in school to support their learning.&nbsp; This has become a unique feature of our school and pupils tell us that they really appreciate being able to learn in this way.&nbsp; To help our students get used to this way of learning, we offer all our new pupils some transition learning tasks via Google Classroom.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Deadline has now passed to sign up for the scheme</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Parents will be contacted when chromebooks are ready to be collected once we have taken delivery of them and they have all been set up.</strong></span></p>

<h4><span>Equipment Requirements</span></h4>
<p><span>All Year 7 students are provided with a pencil case of essential equipment at the start of year.&nbsp; If items are lost or need to be replaced, this is the parent and pupil's responsibility.&nbsp; There is a School Shop available each morning where pupils can buy replacement equipment using cash.&nbsp; Equipment can also be ordered by parents using Scopay.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Minimum equipment:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At least one:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>black pen</span></li>
<li><span>a pencil</span></li>
<li><span>a ruler</span></li>
<li><span>a purple pen</span></li>
<li><span>a whiteboard marker</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span>Additional Maths equipment such as a compass and protractor are required for specific topics in Maths lessons.</span></p>
<h4>Sharing Information About Your Child</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will receive lots of information about your child from their current primary school. We receive information about their academic performance, talents and special needs through a transfer form from their current school. We will also be speaking to your child&rsquo;s current school by telephone to find out any relevant information to make their transition as smooth as possible. However, if there is any additional information that you think we need to know, you can let us know by emailing<span>&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@shevingtonhigh.org.uk">enquiries@shevingtonhigh.org.uk</a>&nbsp;</span>. It is important to us that we have all the relevant information required to ensure a successful start to Year 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will post out the Student Data collection Booklet to home addresses. The information in this Student Data Booklet is essential for us to update our school system with all contact numbers, emails and important parental consent for pupils and key information about the individual student.&nbsp; It is essential all parents return the data collection booklet as soon as possible. You will have the opportunity to hand this in at the Welcome Evening on the 25th April. Spare copies of the booklet&nbsp; are available at the school reception.</span></p>
<h4>The First Day</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Year 7 students are expected to start school on Wednesday 3rd September 2025. Usually students will arrive at 8.45am and assemble in the Main Hall with their form group and form tutor. Students will also be given their timetable. There is no need for your child to bring their PE kit with them on the first day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Things to remember:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&ndash; They should be in their full Shevington High School uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&ndash; Students will need to have their bag and pencil case for when their form tutor discusses what equipment they will need at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&ndash; We hope that every student will purchase lunch from the canteen on this day, so that they are aware of the options available, as well as the procedure for purchasing lunch. Please ensure that your child has funds on the dinner money section of your SCOPAY account or cash to upload onto their accounts. If you are having difficulties arranging this, then please do not hesitate to contact the School Finance Office. Of course, if you prefer, your child may bring a packed lunch on this day, and will still eat with the rest of the year group in the canteen.</span></p>
<h4>The First Few Weeks:</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Your child will be provided with all the information they need to enable a smooth transition in their first few weeks at Shevington High School.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>School Canteen</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Shevington High School has a cashless catering system whereby students use biometric&nbsp; recognition to pay for food in the Canteen.&nbsp; Your child will be registered on taster day or on arrival in September.&nbsp; You are able to top up your child&rsquo;s dinner account using SCOPAY. We recommend that parents set up an &lsquo;email reminder&rsquo; for when the dinner money balance reaches a certain level so that it can be topped up ready for their child to purchase lunch. Details of the canteen food is on our website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a href="../School-Meals/index.html"><strong>School Meals</strong></a></span></p>
<h4>Trip Information</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For every trip that is organised at Shevington High School letters will go home to parents. All trips must be paid via our SCOPAY online payments system.</span></p>
<h4>Travelling To and From School</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Throughout the Induction process, our Year 7 team make it a priority to ensure that every student feels confident travelling to and from school. Your child&rsquo;s form tutor will discuss walking safely to school and the importance of walking with a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; who lives nearby, even if they aren&rsquo;t a friend. We consistently enforce road safety, and welcome contact from parents and members of the public if they observe students being particularly safe or unsafe on the local roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If your child ever has any difficulty getting home (cancellations/lift not arrived) there will always be a member of staff on hand to help, and ensure that they get home safely. Please encourage your child to speak to any member of staff in school if they are unsure of how to get home, and not to leave the school premises until any issues are resolved.</span></p>
<h4>Travelling by Bicycle</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Students may wish to travel to school by bicycle. We have a bicycle store on site, however it is essential that students secure their bicycle with a good quality bike lock. Please ensure your child has the correct fitting safety helmet if travelling by bicycle.</span></p>
<h4>Travelling by Public Transport</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has a proof-of-age card that allows young people to pay the &lsquo;child fare&rsquo; when travelling on public transport. You will find a link to apply for the &lsquo;igo pass&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Useful Links&rsquo; section near the end of this page.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Travelling by Bus</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Bus operators include Shevington High into their routes for use by students. Details of buses that travel to and from Shevington High School and their associated timetables, as well as information on how to purchase an IGO&nbsp; pass, can be found by following the link below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Updated information will be uploaded onto the School website in the Parents section when we receive the new timetable in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a href="../Bus-and-Transport-Information/index.html"><strong>Bus Information</strong></a></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Upholland Bus Service</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The school provides a private bus service operated by Grayway Coaches for our students living in the Upholland/Roby Mill and Appley Bridge area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Timetables will be shared very soon with the routes</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Individual student passes will be available termly and are payable in advance .<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Cost &pound;170.00</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact the Finance Department at the school on 01257 400990.</span></p>
<h4>Music at Shevington High School</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At Shevington High School the music department is one of the thriving hubs of the school. We host a wide range of musical activities each week and support the school with many musical performances from small events like awards evenings to large concerts with 100&rsquo;s of guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One area in which I am currently trying to develop is the uptake/continuation of woodwind, brass and classical string instruments. During primary school, many pupils have access to the &lsquo;wider opps&rsquo; schemes run by music hubs. These allow students to learn instruments in whole class or large group environments. This is fantastic but when they leave and come to Shevington, many students do not know they can continue with this amazing life altering talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Wigan Music Service and myself work closely together and we currently have over 40 students a week learning an instrument in school with nearly half being strings, brass and woodwind. If you do not have access to an instrument the music service charge only &pound;60 a year for the rent of an instrument. We also have some instruments in school to borrow initially to get students up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If your child currently plays or is wanting to play a string, brass or woodwind instrument please consider this with us at Shevington. We also offer drum kit, vocals, guitar and piano lessons. It is an amazing experience and they get so much from it socially but also it improves academic ability, confidence, thinking skills and memory retention. Not only that, it is great to be able to play an instrument!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Lessons are during school time and are currently either 20 minutes @ &pound;12 or 30 minutes @ &pound;18.00. To pay, this is done on ScoPay and payments are a full term up front.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For any more information on contact Mr Beaton&nbsp; via email or ring the school office and ask to speak to the Finance Team.</span></p>

<h4>Moving on up! (Childnet)</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A lot of work goes into helping young people make a smooth transition from primary to secondary education. To help with this Childnet has created a toolkit with videos and lesson plans for adults helping young people aged 10-13 with the online aspects of moving to secondary school.</span></p>

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How do I request for my child to be absent from school, or attend a medical or dental appointment?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For medical or dental appointments, please simply write a note to be handed to the form tutor or main office or email our<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:enquiries@shevingtonhigh.org.uk">enquiries@shevingtonhigh.org.uk</a>&nbsp;email address to notify us of the appointment. At the time they are due to leave, they must sign out at the School Reception and wait for you to collect them. We will not allow pupils to leave school without permission for the Parents/Carers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For all other absences, please visit the Attendance and Absence page, under &lsquo;Parents&rsquo;, on the main school website. Here you will be able to download a Leave of Absence form to complete and returned to the School reception, which will then be passed to the Headteacher for authorisation.&nbsp; Please note that absences in term time can only be authorised in very rare circumstances.&nbsp; Term time holidays will not be authorised and fines may be applicable if these are taken during the school term.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What if my child is ill?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If your child is too ill to come into school, please telephone the school on 01257 400990 and choose the option for Student Absence before 8.45am. You must register your child&rsquo;s absence on every day that they are off school. If an absence is not explained in the morning, then you will receive a truancy call as we must safeguard all child.&nbsp; Any unexplained absences will be investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>What should I do if my child isn&rsquo;t making friends?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Transition can be a difficult time for any child, especially if they are struggling to make friends. It is important to realise that many of our new students are the only child from their Primary School in their year at Shevington High School, so if your child feels as though they haven&rsquo;t made any friends yet then they certainly aren&rsquo;t alone. Naturally, some pupils may take a little longer than other to settle into the routines of secondary school and to cement their long-term friendships. Friendship groups often change regularly, which is completely normal. Most children end Year 7 with totally different friendship groups than those they may have expected as they leave Year 6. Encourage your child to join as many extra-curricular clubs as possible, and not to hide away if they are on their own at break and lunchtimes. If they are really struggling, advise that they speak to their Form Tutor or Head of Year and for further guidance.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How can I help my child with their organisation?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It is important that we allow students to develop their organisational skills independently, and to learn from their mistakes, however it is understandably difficult for a parent not to intervene if they notice that their child is getting notes in their planner for missing equipment. Rather than organising for your child, perhaps provide them with a checklist of things to do each night, with a gentle reminder from you to check the checklist! It can take a while for Year 7s to develop organisational skills, particularly if they haven&rsquo;t had experience of this in Primary School, but most will get there eventually. It is important for students to realise that it is ok to make mistakes, as long as we learn from them and know what to do next time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How do I find out about Extra-curricular clubs?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Extra-curricular activities are usually advertised directly to students or on our school Website. Additionally, staff may make students aware of extra-curricular clubs during lesson time. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that you are aware if they are staying at an after-school club, and they are expected to make their own way home afterwards.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Can girls wear their hair down? Or does it need to be tied up?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pupils can currently wear their hair down if they choose to do so in most lessons.&nbsp; However, students with hair longer than shoulder length should have a hair coloured bobble with them as long hair will need to be tied up for many practical lessons such as Science, PE and Technology and Food.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Is there a bus pass that you can buy for your child? And where do you do this?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will need to look into which bus your child is going to use.&nbsp; Most pupils that travel on buses have an Igo Pass.&nbsp; Details about this can be found on our website.&nbsp; Pupils who pay for a ticket on the private Upholland Bus which leaves from the school should contact school to arrange payment for this service and a pass will be issued through school.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What type of work that pupils will be using their &ldquo;device&rdquo; for? Will an iPad be suitable or will they need a device with a keyboard- for example the Chromebook mentioned via the school?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pupils do lots of different tasks using a device.&nbsp; Pupils can use an iPad so long as they have a keyboard attached to it.&nbsp; Any device that has a keyboard will work.&nbsp; We do like the chromebooks as they have a really long battery life and work very well with the Google Education Suite such as Google Docs, Google Forms, Google Slides and Google Meet.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What time does school finish each day?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The school day ends at 3.00pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>When do we get the timetable?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We usually give out timetables on the first day of school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>When will I know which form I am in?</strong></h3>
<p><span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will be in touch in July with your form groups.&nbsp; We work hard with your primary schools to try to make sure you will be in a group with at least one person that you know and feel comfortable around if this is possible.&nbsp; The language you have shown a preference in also affects which groups you are placed in as different forms do different languages.&nbsp; As we are full to capacity this year, every form group will be full, so once places are allocated it is very difficult to move one student without moving another, so we will ask you to give your form a really good chance. If you are not happy with your group, we ask everyone to remember that everyone makes new friends at secondary school (even if you think you won&rsquo;t).&nbsp; We ask that you try your hardest in your new class but talk to us if you are really worried about anything as we will support you as you get used to your new class and new school.&nbsp; Some lessons will not be taught in form groups, so you will mix with different pupils in those.&nbsp; This includes subjects like Maths, English, Technology and PE.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Which subjects will I be studying in Year 7?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will study a full range of subjects when school returns to some kind of normal situation (or you will do these via google classroom if we are still working remotely)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will study: Maths, English, Science, a Modern Language, History, Geography, Art, Drama, PE, PSHE, Technology, Computer Science and Religious Studies.&nbsp; You will also have a workshop lesson where you work on your termly mission, or any work for other subjects that you need to develop or improve.</span></p>

<p><span>The lack of equipment in lessons hinders effective learning and independence. We want all students to achieve the highest academic excellence and take responsibility for their learning. The first step is to be equipped and ready for the lessons ahead, to this end we expect all students to have basic equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>All Year 7 students are provided with a pencil case of essential equipment at the start of year.&nbsp; If items are lost or need to be replaced, this is the parent and pupil's responsibility.&nbsp; There is a School Shop available each morning where pupils can buy replacement equipment using cash.&nbsp; Equipment can also be ordered by parents using Scopay.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Minimum equipment:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At least one:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>black pen</span></li>
<li><span>a pencil</span></li>
<li><span>a ruler</span></li>
<li><span>a purple pen</span></li>
